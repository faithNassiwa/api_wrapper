# API-Wrapper

The purpose of this project is to build an API Wrapper package in Python that encapsulates multiple API calls. The goals of this project include: -

•	Develop a package that is designed specifically for Python to access Public APIs (Matheus 2022), taking advantage of Python's unique language features and working smoothly with Python's data types.
•	The API wrapper will encapsulate multiple API calls and simplify the process of interacting with Web APIs by running functions for accessing the data.
•	Document the API purely in Python terms, convert the JSON data into data frame, so that the programmer does not need to read the documentation, and translate into Python.
